<h2>Student Grade Calculator (Java)</h2>
<p>
This is a simple Java console application that helps calculate a student's grade based on marks entered for multiple subjects. 
It uses a menu-driven approach, making it easy to enter marks and view results repeatedly.
</p>

<h3>How It Works</h3>
<ul>
  <li>On starting, the program asks for the number of subjects.</li>
  <li>A menu is displayed with options to:
    <ul>
      <li>Enter marks for the student</li>
      <li>See the result (total, average, and grade)</li>
      <li>Exit the program</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Marks are validated to ensure they are between 0 and 100.</li>
  <li>The program calculates total marks, average percentage, and assigns a grade based on the average.</li>
</ul>
